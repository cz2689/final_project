# **Introduction** 

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, marijuana is known by different names, such as weed, cannabis, pot, hemp etc. It is a mossy type of plant and refers to the dried flowers, leaves, stems, and seeds of cannabis plants. People commonly take them through smoking, vaping, or consuming marijuana-infused food. Then, cannabis will be carried to the brain via blood circulation. They bind to receptors and further change our behaviours.
<br>

Marijuana contains more than 100 components (cannabinoids). Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the main active component that changes people’s mood and behaviour, and causes the “high” (hallucination or paranoia). Another well-known active chemical is cannabidiol (CBD,) but it does not cause a “high.” CBD reduces the psychoactive effects caused by THC and lower anxiety, which inspired the development of plant-based marijuana drugs. The [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-and-cannabis-research-and-drug-approval-process) has approved a cannabis-derived drug, Epidiolex, a purified form of CBD. This drug can be used to treat seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Dravet syndrome, and tuberous sclerosis complex. Additionally, the FDA approved Marinol, Syndros, and Cesamet, three synthetic cannabis-related drugs.

While specially treated marijuana can be used medically, it still poses a number of health risks. In this website, we want to focus on the association between marijuana use and depression.

# **Motivation**

There are around 48 million people in US using marijuana, and it could lead to various health impacts. As more and more states legalize marijuana, marijuana use has been causing significant social impacts and attracting a vast amount of public attention. The legality of marijuana use remains controversial in the US. Each state has their own restrictions on their marijuana laws for both medical and recreational purposes. Based on data from the “World Population Review,” by July 2022, 14 states have fully legalized the use of marijuana. In this project, we will evaluate the association among marijuana use and depression, and we would like to propose recommendations for future studies and policies.

# **Website Overview **

In this project, we aim to understand the association between marijuana use and mental health burdens based on the 2019 NSDUH data set. A wide range of demographic and sociodemographic variables, such as sex, age, and region, will also be stratified or adjusted in the data analysis step. We want to provide suggestions on marijuana legalization for future substance prevention programs and policymakers.
